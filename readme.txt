Build and manage Content Security Policy headers with ease.

== Description ==
aCSP Builder helps you create and implement Content Security Policy (CSP) headers for your WordPress site.

**Quick Start Presets**
Choose from three security levels:
* **Relaxed** - Good for beginners, allows common external services
* **Balanced** - Moderate security with nonce protection
* **Strict** - Maximum security, same-origin only

**Main Features**
* Automatic nonce injection for scripts and styles
* Hash-based allow-list for inline code
* Live header preview before activation
* Meta tag injection option for additional compatibility
* Custom policy builder for advanced configuration
* Report-Only mode for testing
* Export/import settings as JSON
* Works with popular page builders

**How It Works**
1. Install and activate the plugin
2. Choose a preset or build custom policy
3. Test in Report-Only mode
4. Switch to Enforce mode when ready

== Installation ==
1. Upload plugin files to `/wp-content/plugins/acsp-builder/` or install via WordPress plugins screen
2. Activate the plugin
3. Go to **Admin â†’ aCSP Builder**
4. Select a preset and configure as needed

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Will this break my site? =
Start with Report-Only mode to test without affecting your site. The plugin shows exactly what headers will be sent.

= What are nonces? =
Nonces are security tokens that verify trusted scripts and styles. The plugin automatically adds them without editing templates.

= Can I allow external domains? =
Yes. Each directive includes common domains (Google Fonts, Analytics, etc.) and custom URL fields.

= Does it work with caching? =
Works with object caching (Redis, etc.). Page caching may require additional configuration.

= Is this plugin free? =
Yes. Donations via [Buy Me a Coffee](https://buymeacoffee.com/awhadikf) are appreciated but not required.
